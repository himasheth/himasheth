## hello! my name is hima (she/her) 
### :sparkles: i'm a software developer passionate about tech for social good :sparkles:

I'm a creative problem solver hoping to use tech to solve larger problems in the world. Iâ€™m interested in product/project management, full stack development, technical writing, and fintech!! I'm currently a Computer Science Student studying at University of Waterloo. 

Outside of school I like to spend my time travelling to new places and exploring new cultures, baking a sweet treat, or singing! I'm currently working on developing my personal website and hope to have that up soon! I'm incorporating my love for travel through the use of an interactive map :earth_americas:. Stay tuned for an update!

I've recently found a summer internship for 2021 and I'm working towards preparing for it! I'm also pursuing my interest in tech for social good at [UW Blueprint](http://uwblueprint.org/) as a project dev as well as working with [Dimagi](https://www.dimagi.com/) to create an app to diagnose/control the spread the spread of Tuberculosis. I'm also working as a full stack developer at [UW's Entrepreneurship Society](http://entsoc.ca/). In my spare time, I'm working on my personal website but also reading about other sectors in tech such as fintech, e-commerce, and technical writing. Please feel free to reach out if you want to discuss any of these topics! I'm always looking for others to learn from.
