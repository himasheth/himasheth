## hello! my name is hima (she/her) 
### :sparkles: i'm a software developer passionate about tech for social good :sparkles:

I'm a creative problem solver hoping to use tech to solve larger problems in the world. Iâ€™m interested in product/project management, full stack development, technical writing, and fintech!! I'm currently a Computer Science Student studying at University of Waterloo. 

Outside of school I like to spend my time travelling to new places and exploring new cultures, baking a sweet treat, or singing! I'm currently working on developing my personal website and hope to have that up soon! I'm incorporating my love for travel through the use of an interactive map :earth_americas:. Stay tuned for an update!

### the present day
I'm recently finished an internship as a **software developer intern @ Auvik Networks Inc**. in Waterloo, Ontario! I worked on the product growth team where I develpper full stack applications to increase turnover from free trial users to paid subscribers! I also worked alongside a tech lead to investigate testing/code quality across the engineering department and propose a test plan to unify the efforts across the board. My next destination is **HubSpot in Cambridge, MA, USA** for their Spring (Jan-April 2022) Software Engineering Internship!

I'm pursuing my interest in tech for social good at [UW Blueprint](http://uwblueprint.org/) where I worked a project developer. I'm also a [Hack the North](https://hackthenorth.com/) organizer (Canada's biggest hackathon)! In my spare time, I'm working on my personal website but also reading about other sectors in tech such as fintech, e-commerce, and mapping/geo work. Please feel free to reach out if you want to discuss any of these topics! I'm always looking for others to learn from.
